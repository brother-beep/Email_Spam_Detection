# Email_Spam_Detection

This repository contains code and resources for email spam detection. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify incoming emails as either spam or not spam.

## Features

- **Data preprocessing**: Includes various techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and transform the email data.
- **Feature extraction**: Utilizes technique like bag-of-words to convert the email text into numerical features.
- **Machine learning models**: Implements popular algorithm like Naive Bayes, for training and testing the spam detection model.
- **Evaluation metrics**: Calculates performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the effectiveness of the trained models.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/brother-beep/Email_Spam_Detection.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script:'streamlit run sms.py'

## Usage

To use the email spam detection model, follow these steps:

1. Provide the path to the email dataset.
2. Adjust any desired configuration settings in the same file.
3. Run the main script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. After training, you can use the trained model to classify new incoming emails by calling the appropriate functions.
